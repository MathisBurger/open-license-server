# open-license-server
Open-License-Server is an little project made to learn more about rust.
I finished it and it will not be developed in future.
It is not made for use in production. 
I made it to use it as a backend for some tiny license-based projects.
Its perfect for closed-beta versions of games or other small applications.

## Installation
Therefore I do not recommend to use it in production, I will not show you how to install it correctly.
If you want to try it, you can figure it out yourself :)
