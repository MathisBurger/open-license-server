# open-license-server
Open-License-Server is an little project made to learn more about rust.
I finished it and it will not be developed in future.
It is not made for use in production. 
I made it to use it as a backend for some tiny license-based projects.
Its perfect for closed-beta versions of games or other small applications.
The API is easy to use and in future I will add some wrapper for different languages 
like golang, rust, c#, python, java and other.
